This file lists all 3rd party libraries (and their versions!!!) that
are required to build or run the project.

Some notes:

- Each 3rd party library is stored in a directory named after the
  open-source project or company that created it.  This makes for
  easy organization of lots of libs.

- Jar files stored _do not_ have version numbers
  actually in their file name.  If the jar originally comes as such,
  it is renamed with the version number stripped off.  The version
  number is instead maintained in this file.  The reason for this is
  so that every time we need to upgrade any 3rd party library,
  we don't have to edit any build.xml or properies files to reflect
  a potential name change due to a version number - you just note
  that change once in this file and overwrite the old jar, checking
  in that overwrite to CVS in the process.

- Each 3rd party lib is listed here along with what it is
  used for and if its needed for build-time, run-time or both.

- Thanks to the gents working on the Spring Framework (http://www.springframework.org)
  that provided the template and the idea for this file.


* jakarta-commons/commons-logging.jar
- Commons Logging 1.0.4 (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging)
- required for building JSecurity
- required at runtime as JSecurity uses it for all logging

* jarjar/jarjar.jar
- Tonic Systems JarJar 0.6 (http://tonicsystems.com/products/jarjar/)
- Required at build time to create a single jar from multiple jars
