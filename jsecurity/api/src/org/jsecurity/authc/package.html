This package contains core JSecurity interfaces and exceptions concerning Authentication
(the act of loggin-in).

<p>JSecurity abbreviates the word 'Authentication' as authc to distinguish it seperately from
'Authorization', abbreviated as authz</p>

<p>The primary class of interest here is the <tt>Authenticator</tt> interface.  All other classes
and sub-packages mostly support the behavior of <tt>Authenticator</tt> implementations.
