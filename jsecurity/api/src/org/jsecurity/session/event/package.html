Classes used to support JSecurity's event driven design for session management.

<p>SessionEvents are triggered based on something notable occurring during a session, such as a session
    expiration, or user log-out, or explicit invalidation.  View the
    <tt>SessionEventListener</tt> interface for more information on the types of events that may
    be acted upon.</p>
