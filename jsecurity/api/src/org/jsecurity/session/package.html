The Session package contains all interfaces and exceptions related to managing application
sessions, the time-based contexts in which a Subject (aka user) interacts with an application.

<p>Sessions in JSecurity are completely POJO-based and do not <em>require</em> an application to use
Web-based or EJB-based session management infrastructure - the client and/or server technoloy is
irrelevent in JSecurity's architecture, allowing session management to be employed in the smallest
standalone application to the largest enterprise deployments.</p>
<p>This design decision opens up a new world to Java applications - most notably the ability to
participate in a session regardless if the client is using HTTP, custom sockets, web services,
or whatever.  Currently no technology in Java today allows this heterogenous client-session
capability.  Because of this freedom, JSecurity naturally supports Single Sign-On for any
application.</p>
