This file lists all 3rd party libraries (and their versions!!!) that
are required to build or run the project.

If you're a developer editing this file, please keep all listings in alphabetical order for
convenient lookup.

Some notes:

- Each 3rd party library is stored in a directory named after the
  open-source project or company that created it.  This makes for
  easy organization of lots of libs.

- Jar files stored _do not_ have version numbers
  actually in their file name.  If the jar originally comes as such,
  it is renamed with the version number stripped off.  The version
  number is instead maintained in this file.  The reason for this is
  so that every time we need to upgrade any 3rd party library,
  we don't have to edit any build.xml or properies files to reflect
  a potential name change due to a version number - you just note
  that change once in this file and overwrite the old jar, checking
  in that overwrite to CVS in the process.

- Each 3rd party lib is listed here along with what it is
  used for and if its needed for build-time, run-time or both.
