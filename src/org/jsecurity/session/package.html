The Session package contains all interfaces and exceptions related to managing application
sessions, the time-based data contexts in which a Subject interacts with an application.

<p>Sessions in JSecurity are completely POJO-based and do not <em>require</em> an application to use
    Web-based or EJB-based session management infrastructure - the client and/or server technoloy is
    irrelevent in JSecurity's architecture, allowing session management to be employed in the smallest
    standalone application to the largest enterprise deployments.</p>

<p>This design decision opens up a new world to Java applications - most notably the ability to
    participate in a session regardless if the client is using HTTP, custom sockets, web services,
    or whatever. Aside from JSecurity, there is currently no technology in Java today allows this
    heterogenous client-session capability. Because of this freedom, JSecurity naturally supports
    Single Sign-On for any application.</p>
