<p>Core support package providing JSecurity's default Realm implementation hierarchy for easy re-use and extension
in specific runtime environments (JDBC, LDAP, file, etc).</p>

<p>Instead of writing a <tt>Realm</tt> implementation from scratch, it is highly recommended to use the classes in
    this package or its subpackages as your realm, or as a superclass for your custom 
    implementation to save you some coding time, guarantee consistency, and leverage well-tested pre-existing logic.</p>
