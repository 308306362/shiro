<p>Realm implementations that use RAM/heap-space transient memory to store and acquire security data.</p>

<p>Since RAM/heap-space is never persistent upon application shut-down, implementations in this package are
    <em>not</em> recommended for production use (JSecurity's defaults are production capable and never based on
    pure memory implementations).  The implementations here are priarily for testing or provided as superclasses for
    more persistent mechanisms.</p>
