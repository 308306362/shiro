Core interfaces and exceptions supporting Authorization (access control).

<p>JSecurity abbreviates the word 'AuthoriZation' as <tt>authz</tt> to distinguish it seperately from
    'AuthentiCation', abbreviated as <tt>authc</tt>.</p>

<p>The primary interface of interest, which is the core of JSecurity authorization functionality,
    is the <tt>Authorizer</tt>. This interface handles all aspects of principal-related security and is
    the facade to all other JSecurity authorization components.</p>

<p>JSecurity has the ability to authorize subjects (a.k.a. users) without being intrusive to
    the application's domain model. Most applications will utilize the concepts of
    <tt>group</tt>s, <tt>role</tt>s, and <tt>permission</tt>s, but JSecurity tries to be
    as non-invasive as possible doesn't require any such interfaces (although a Permission interface
    is made available for fine-grained access control policies if you want to use
    JSecurity's permission support out-of-the-box).</p>

<p>Although
    it is possible for applications to implement this and other interfaces directly, it is not
    recommended. JSecurity already has base implementations in the
    <tt>org.jsecurity.authz.support</tt> package which
    should be suitable for 99% of deployments.
    Most applications should be able to use these
    existing components via configuration only and be up and running very quickly. See the
    API or the JSecurity.org website quick-start for how to accomplish this
    instead of writing an implementation from scratch.</p>

<p>Finally, as is the case with most all of JSecurity interfaces and components, they can be used
    programmatically, but it is highly recommended to use the JSecurity JDK 1.5 annotations and/or
    configuration to reduce or eliminate such effort.</p>
