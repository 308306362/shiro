<p>Provides interfaces and implementations used in <em>bind</em>ing a <tt>SecurityContext</tt> to an application after
it is created and/or acquired.</p>

<p>Usually after a <tt>SecurityContext</tt> is created or acquired, it is desireable to transparently bind the
<tt>SecurityContext</tt> to the application in some fashion for easy lookup later.</p>

<p>For example, in web appliations,
after a <tt>SecurityContext</tt> is created for the first time, it is often desireable to bind it to the 
HttpRequest or thread in some way so that it is accessible for the duration of the request, and potentially made
    available for subsequent requests.  In a standalone application, this binding may be done via a static class
attribute, or better yet, by adding it to a global application-level context (e.g. using Spring or Pico).</p>
