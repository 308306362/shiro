Classes and interfaces related to JSecurity's root-level concept of a Security Context.

<p>A SecurityContext is <em>the</em> entry point to using JSecurity programatically, and it is the
    handle to any accessible application security data.  All
authorization and session components are obtained via the SecurityContext.  Different implementations
of the SecurityContext maintain how an application's security infrastructure operates.</p>
