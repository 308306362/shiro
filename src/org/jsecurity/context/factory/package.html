<p>Provides interfaces and implementations to support constructing a <tt>SecurityContext</tt> instance after a
successful subject (aka 'user') authentication.</p>

<p>After a subject/user successfully authenticates with the system, a <tt>SecurityContext</tt> must be
constructed to represent that user's access rights as well as allow access to a <tt>Session</tt> if desired.
This package provides the <tt>SecurityContextFactory</tt> interface that allows subclass implementations to
construct a <tt>SecurityContext</tt> instance after successful log-in.</p>
