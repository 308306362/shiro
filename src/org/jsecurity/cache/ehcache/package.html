<p>Contains <a href="http://ehcache.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">ehcache</a>-based implementations of
the JSecurity <tt>CacheManager</tt> and <tt>Cache</tt> interfaces via the <tt>EhCacheManager</tt> and
<tt>EhCache</tt> implementations, respectively.</p>

<p>This package also contains a fail-safe ehcache.xml file that will be loaded by JSecurity when ehcache components
are used, but no ehcache.xml file is located in the classpath (as would be customary for ehcache usage).</p>
