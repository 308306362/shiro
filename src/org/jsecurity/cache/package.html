<p>Contains all caching-related interfaces and exceptions utilized by the framework for performance-enhancing
caching during runtime.</p>

<p>In good interface-driven design fashion, JSecurity uses the <tt>Cache</tt> and <tt>CacheProvider</tt>
interfaces to separate implementation details from framework components.  A <tt>CacheProvider</tt> is
responsible for creating and managing <tt>Cache</tt>s.  A <tt>Cache</tt> is, as its name implies, a key-value based
data map.</p>

<p>Common underlying <tt>CacheProvider</tt> and <tt>Cache</tt> implementations support anything from
simple map-based memory caches to Ehcache to distributed network caches like JBoss cache.</p>
