<p>Components used to support the framework's AOP/interception support classes.</p>

<p>As this package is a root-level package under <tt>org.jsecurity</tt>, it contains AOP support classes
    useful for any AOP environment and/or function. Feature-dependent AOP classes (e.g. authorization,
    authentication, etc) will use these classes as their base in their respective packages.</p>
