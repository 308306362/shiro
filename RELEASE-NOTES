This is not an official release notes document.  It exists for Shiro developers
to jot down their notes while working in the source code.  These notes will be
combined with Jira's auto-generated release notes during a release for the
total set.

# 1.2.0
###########################################################

Backwards Incompatible Changes
--------------------------------
- The following org.apache.shiro.mgt.DefaultSecurityManager methods have been removed:
  bindPrincipalsToSession(principals, context)

  This logic has been moved into a SubjectDAO concept to allow end-users to control
  exactly how the Session may be used for subject state persistence.  This allows a
  single point of control rather than needing to configure Shiro in multiple places.

  If you overrode this method in Shiro 1.0 or 1.2, please look at the new
  org.apache.shiro.mgt.DefaultSubjectDAO implementation, which performs compatible logic.

Potential Breaking Changes
--------------------------------
- The org.apache.shiro.web.filter.mgt.FilterChainManager class's
  addFilter(String name, Filter filter) semantics have changed.  It now no longer
  attempts to initialize a filter by default before adding the filter to the chain.
  If you ever called this method, you can call the
  addFilter(name, filter, true) method to achieve the <= 1.1 behavior.

###########################################################
# 1.1.0
###########################################################

Backwards Incompatible Changes
--------------------------------
- The org.apache.shiro.web.util.RedirectView class's
  appendQueryProperties(StringBuffer targetUrl, Map model, String encodingScheme)
  method has been changed to accept a StringBuilder argument instead of a
  StringBuffer per SHIRO-191.  RedirectView is considered an internal
  implementation support class and Shiro end-users should not be affected by this.
