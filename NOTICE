Apache Shiro
Copyright 2008-2011 The Apache Software Foundation

This product includes software developed at
The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).

The implementation for org.apache.shiro.util.SoftHashMap is based 
on initial ideas from Dr. Heinz Kabutz's publicly posted version 
available at http://www.javaspecialists.eu/archive/Issue015.html,
with continued modifications.  

Certain parts (StringUtils etc.) of the source code for this 
product was copied for simplicity and to reduce dependencies 
from the source code developed by the Spring Framework Project 
(http://www.springframework.org).

Shiro's BCrypt Hashing support is a modification of Damien Miller's
jBCrypt project at http://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/, a
port of OpenBSD's BCrypt algorithm to Java.  Per his BSD-style
license, the following remains in-tact:

// all copies.
Note that this attribution statement applies to Shiro's BCrypt hash
class only, not Shiro in general.
