Core interfaces and exceptions supporting Authorization (access control).

<p>JSecurity abbreviates the word 'AuthoriZation' as <tt>authz</tt> to distinguish it seperately from
'AuthentiCation', abbreviated as <tt>authc</tt>.</p>

<p>The primary interface of interest, which is the core of JSecurity authorization functionality,
is the <tt>AuthorizationContext</tt>.  This interface handles all aspects of authorization and is
the facade to all other JSecurity authorization components.</p>

<p>JSecurity has the ability to authorize subjects (a.k.a. users) without being intrusive to
the application's domain model.  Most applications will utilize the concepts of
<tt>group</tt>s, <tt>role</tt>s, and <tt>permission</tt>s, but JSecurity doesn't require that
you implement any such interfaces.  Instead, JSecurity abstracts itself away from domain
specifics by allowing applications to use an implementation of the <tt>AuthorizationContext</tt>
interface.</p>

<p>Although
it is possible for applications to implement this and other interfaces directly, it is not
recommended.  The JSecurity Reference Implementation (RI) already has base implementations which
should be suitable for 99% of deployments.  Most applications should be able to use these
existing components via configuration only and be up and running very quickly.  See the
Reference Implementation API or the JSecurity.org website quick-start for how to accomplish this
instead of writing an implementation from scratch.</p>

<p>Finally, as is the case with most all of JSecurity interfaces and components, they can be used
programmatically, but it is highly recommended to use the JSecurity RI JDK 1.5 annotations and/or
configuration to reduce or eliminate such effort.</p>
